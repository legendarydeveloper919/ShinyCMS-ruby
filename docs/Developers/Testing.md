# ShinyCMS: Testing

You should run rubocop and the test suite, and fix any issues they find, before
submitting a pull request. I recommend running them more often than that. :)


## Code formatting

To run the linter: `rubocop`


## Test suite

To run the test suite: `rspec`


## Git Hooks

To install git hooks to run rubocop and the tests automatically when you commit
or push new code, install [Overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) and
follow its instructions.
