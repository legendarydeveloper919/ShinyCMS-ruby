# ShinyCMS Developer Documentation

## In progress

Everything that was in this document has now been moved to the [ShinyCMS project board](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/projects/1) (along with about half of the TODO list)


## Done / TODO

See the [done](done.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I have already implemented in this version - as well as a few new ones that snuck in along the way - with notes on improvements from the Perl version where applicable.

See the [TODO](TODO.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I haven't started implementing in this version yet... as well as ideas for new features, that I'm trying to resist building until I've caught up with the Perl feature list.
