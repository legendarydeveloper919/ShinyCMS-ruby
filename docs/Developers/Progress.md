# ShinyCMS: Project goals and progress

The original, [Perl version of ShinyCMS](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS) was built to satisfy
the varied requirements of a number of clients during 10 years of working as a freelance web
developer, so it's not a small project. Even though I built the vast majority of it, I was still
surprised at the length of the feature list when I wrote it out at the start of this project.

My intention is to re-implement all of those features in the Ruby version, with improvements,
as 'Phase 1' of this project - then move onto adding new features after that.


## Done / In Progress / TODO

See the [done](done.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I have already implemented
in this version - as well as a few new ones that snuck in along the way - with notes on improvements
from the Perl version where applicable.

See the [in-progress](in-progress.md) list for features that I am currently working on
(with notes on where I'm up to, and links to useful docs).

See the [TODO](TODO.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I haven't started implementing
in this version yet... as well as ideas for new features, that I'm trying to resist building until I've
caught up with the Perl feature list.
