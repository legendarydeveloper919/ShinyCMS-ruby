# ShinyCMS Features

## MJML email templates

All of the emails generated by ShinyCMS are templated using MJML - a simple markup language that gets converted into responsive HTML email markup at the time of sending.

The key advantage of using MJML is that the generated HTML is tailored according to the recipient's email address, compensating for known differences in how a number of the most popular email apps and websites display HTML emails:  
* Gmail (Android, iPhone, and website)
* Outlook (Android, iPhone, and website) and Outlook 365
* Android (default email client)
* Apple Mail (OS X and iOS)
* AOL Mail
* Yahoo Mail
