# ShinyCMS Features

## Comments

The comments feature can be enabled/disabled on blog and news posts in general, and also turned on or off for specific posts while generally enabled.

Comments replies are properly nested, so you can clearly see who is replying to who.

Comment posting has bot protection via reCAPTCHA, and spam-flagging via Akismet.
