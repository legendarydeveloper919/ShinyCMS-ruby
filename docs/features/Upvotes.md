# ShinyCMS Features

## Upvotes

### AKA 'likes', '+1', etc

The upvote/likes/+1 features are powered by ActsAsVotable

https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable#readme

The feature also offers downvotes; there are separate settings to turn on just the upvote feature, or both up and downvotes.

TODO: should be a feature flag to turn on/off the whole voteable feature-set, and then a setting for 'allow_downvotes'
