# ShinyCMS Features

## Admin features

### Admin area

The CMS has an admin area, imaginatively located at /admin

Any CMS feature (whether built-in or a plugin) that allows you update content or change settings will make itself available to you in this admin area - either by providing its own menu section, or by adding itself to the 'Other' menu section.

### Admin toolbar

If you are logged into a user account with suitable admin privileges, a toolbar will appear at the bottom of every page on the main site - usually including some context-aware links to the admin area, allowing you to easily edit the content you are currently looking at (assuming that you have the access to do so).

### ACL

Access to all of the admin features is controlled by a fine-grain ACL. You can edit individual user's capabilities on their Edit User page, granting or removing access to particular features or sets of features.
