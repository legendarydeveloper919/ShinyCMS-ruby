# ShinyCMS: ShinyForms plugin

This is a form handler plugin for [ShinyCMS](https://shinycms.com); it provides
a few different endpoints to which you can POST a suitably constructed HTML form,
and they will do Something Useful [tm] with it. The simplest example emails the
form data to the site owner - this allows you to quickly and easily add a new
contact form or an order enquiry form to your ShinyCMS-powered site.

Form handlers are created, configured, and controlled via the ShinyCMS admin area;
look for 'Form Handlers' in your admin menu after enabling this plugin.


## Installation

Uncomment or add this line in your main ShinyCMS Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'shiny_forms', path: 'plugins/ShinyForms'
```

To install the gem into your copy of ShinyCMS:
```bash
bundle install
```

To add the ShinyForms tables and supporting data to your ShinyCMS database:
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rails shiny_forms:install:data
rails shiny_forms:install:data
rails shiny_forms:install:migrations
rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test rails db:migrate
```
