# ShinyCMS

[ShinyCMS](https://shinycms.org/) is an open-source content management system
intended for use by web designers and web developers who want to keep a clear
distinction between the markup they create and the content their clients can
edit.

This version is built in Ruby on Rails, and has support for cloud hosting
(Heroku, AWS, etc).

This rewrite started out as as an educational exercise, giving me an opportunity
to build a Ruby on Rails application from scratch and largely by myself. It's
also been nice to have time for proper testing (100% coverage!), regular
refactoring, and all the other things I don't get to do enough of at work :)

## Installation and configuration

If you want to set up a website using ShinyCMS, please read the
[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md) guide.

### Demo site

Theme templates and sample data for a demo site are provided, so you can try
all of the CMS features without doing any set-up work.


## System dependencies

* A webserver - I use `rails s` locally, and deploy to Heroku
* A database - for now this assumes Postgres
* An email server or service - anything that ActionMailer supports

### Services

External services are mostly optional. If you add config settings for them
(in ENV, .env*, or Heroku config vars) then they will be enabled, otherwise
either those features will be disabled or a fallback will take their place.

### Ruby and Rails versions

ShinyCMS requires Rails 6 (which in turn requires Ruby 2.5 or later), and
generally uses the most recent stable release of both Ruby and Rails
(currently Ruby 2.7.1 and Rails 6.0.3).

It has been tested on every release of Rails 6 so far, and with most versions
of Ruby from 2.5.8 onwards ([view recent test results][test results] for ruby
2.5.8, 2.6.6, and 2.7.1).

[Test results]: https://travis-ci.org/github/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/builds/695548431

There are currently no plans to add support for Rails 5 or older Ruby versions.
